# FORCETTY

Some programs obnoxiously buffer their output if they detect that they aren't
outputing to a pty, in ways that `stdbuf -iL -oL` can't fix.  This is
particularly problematic when filtering the output of a log file where the
program streaming out the logs does this buffering, because log events may be
indefinitely delayed if there is little activity being logged (`aws logs tail
--follow` is one of these).

This tiny wrapper forks the specified program controlled by a pty, and writes
its output to the parent's stdout.

Handles SIGCHLD:
- Normal child exit: exits parent, propagating child's exit status.
- Child killed with signal: exits (status 0)
- Child dumped: exits (status 0)

On SIGINT, SIGTERM to parent: exits as expected.

## EXAMPLE

``` sh
forcetty aws logs tail /aws/lambda/foo --since 1m --follow --color off | fancy_logs_filter
```

## BUILDING

``` sh
make
sudo make install
```

See the top of the tiny `Makefile` for configuration knobs.
